# Parallel Programming Analysis

*  Implement basic parallel program concepts
*  Generate performance results
*  Result analysis through write ups, graphs, and tables
*  The programs are focused on understanding the benefits and concepts of parallelizing programs. Majority of code skeletons were given by the professor. I filled in certain code algorithms and OpenMP and OpenCL directives.
