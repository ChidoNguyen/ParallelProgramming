# ParallelProgramming

1. Project 0: Introduction to OpenMP and Parallel Programming advantages in terms of performance value
2. Project 1: Analyzing how parallel programming can help solve problems ( i.e. volume between 2 surfaces)
3. Project 2: Schedule + Fine vs Coarse Parallelism
4. Project 3: False Sharing Impact Analysis 

Some core parallel code was given by the professor. The class focused on analysis and benefits of parallel programming with some basic code implemented by me.
